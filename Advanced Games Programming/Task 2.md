# Educational Game Plan

For this task it is asked to develop an educational maths game aimed at teaching basic arithmatic, involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The target audience is primary schoolers and the time given by the client is 8 weeks of 8 sprints. This will be worked on by a group of three people with different expertise, these being:
* A general developer on coding and mechanics
* A specialist in dialogue systems and localization
* A specialist in UI/UX design
Based on this it should become simpler do divide the roles to ensure the client gets a fully implemented project within the asked amount of time.

To start off with, its better to establish a proper working plan that will efficiently incorporate each member of the team. Trello will be used as it is an online resource that everyone can access easily, and gives tools tp neatly sort each sprint and the work each member will be required to do. Within I can create the 8 different sprints on each list, with at least one job for each member of the group, alongside this an extra list can be created for all the tasks to be placed on before sorting. This is important to do as it allows me to better sort things since they are all in one place, before they get sorted in terms of impoartance for the project and how possible they would be for the different developers to work on in a given sprint.

## Sprint Plans

### Sprint 1

For this first sprint it would be wise to get the planning portion out of the way to ensure that each member of the team can decide on their goals within the project. This also allows us to gather important information and generate ideas on different elements, such as the style of the game and the levels of difficulty we aim to reach.  
Alongside this, research into other online maths games would prove useful, as some online maths games remain popular among students of that younger age group. Such websites like Sumdog are highly popular because they use simple mathematics in conjunction with background animations and sounds to simulate a game environment, to use an example.

### Sprint 2

Sprint 2 should be that start of the development process, as all of the research and pllanning should have been finished within the first week of the project. The basic plan would be to create the framework of the game, which includes the main logic behind the operations and
