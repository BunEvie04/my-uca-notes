# Educational Game Plan

For this task it is asked to develop an educational maths game aimed at teaching basic arithmatic, involving addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The target audience is primary schoolers and the time given by the client is 8 weeks of 8 sprints. This will be worked on by a group of three people with different expertise, these being:
* A general developer on coding and mechanics
* A specialist in dialogue systems and localization
* A specialist in UI/UX design
Based on this it should become simpler do divide the roles to ensure the client gets a fully implemented project within the asked amount of time.

To start off with, its better to establish a proper working plan that will efficiently incorporate each member of the team. Trello will be used as it is an online resource that everyone can access easily, and gives tools tp neatly sort each sprint and the work each member will be required to do. Within I can create the 8 different sprints on each list, with at least one job for each member of the group, alongside this an extra list can be created for all the tasks to be placed on before sorting. This is important to do as it allows me to better sort things since they are all in one place, before they get sorted in terms of impoartance for the project and how possible they would be for the different developers to work on in a given sprint.

## Sprint Plans

This section should provide a brief overview of the planned activities across each sprint, each with a small explanation on why it was decided to do each task on this section of development.
Each sprint for this project will be lasting one week, with the group having a stand-up every other week to go over the stages of development that each member is at, to ensure that everyoone can get help if they need it.

### Sprint 1

For this first sprint it would be wise to get the planning portion out of the way to ensure that each member of the team can decide on their goals within the project. This also allows us to gather important information and generate ideas on different elements, such as the style of the game and the levels of difficulty we aim to reach.  

Alongside this, research into other online maths games would prove useful, as some online maths games remain popular among students of that younger age group. Such websites like Sumdog are highly popular because they use simple mathematics in conjunction with background animations and sounds to simulate a game environment, to use an example.

### Sprint 2

Sprint 2 should be that start of the development process, as all of the research and pllanning should have been finished within the first week of the project. The basic plan for this stage would be to create the framework of the game, which includes the main logic behind the operations and the starting foundations of the visual design of the game aspects itself.  

For the third developer on the dialogue systems, this sprint will rely on them creating a script for the game. For this week they will focus on the general text being displayed to the player, so it'd have to, like most other things, be accommodated towards the target age.

### Sprint 3

The third sprint will just be a continueation of the second, with a meeting at the start of the week to bring everyone up to speed, as a way to tell where everyone is with their respective jobs.

The main goal is to have the core game setup with the operations and have it all be playable, this way the project can be shown off as a full proof of concept. The script should be finished this week as it will be necessary for the next sprint. Over the course of the next couple of weeks, the UI will be developed so that it can be integrated and used with future elements.

### Sprint 4

Using the UI developed in the previous sprint, the developers on mechanics and dialogue will be working together on setting up and fleshing out a dialogue system. This will be a joint effort as there may be issues conncting the two areas that would be better worked on with both people simultaneously.

The UI designercan partake in ensuring the dialogue boxes are fit for purpose and work appropriately. Alongside this, the other required UI elements should be fleshed out this sprint so that the user testing (aimed to be the focus of next week) can be performed in its basic capacity.

### Sprint 5

As mentioned previously, this week should hopefully be focused on getting a working build ready for users to test and provide feedback. Each week will hopefully provide newer builds with revised builds using the feedback from the user testing.

During this process extra resources will be used on animations, it is still to be decided who would have the most experience with this so it will mainly fall into the UX designers job with everyone else working as extra help.

### Sprint 6

This week will be a little bit busier as each member will have a different role. Alongside this, the team will be recieving the first bits of feedback from users on how the testing build is, this would be vital and will need to be implemented in the upcoming sprints.

The progress tracking systems will bee implemented for teachers to be able to monitor a student's results to help teach them if they are falling a bit behind.

Since english was the default language, it will not need to be localized, instead the first decided localized language would be Spanish. As this isn't a large project it should only take less than a week to localise.

The UX designer will be focusing on sound design, as this was deemed not important enough to be in the first couple of testing builds.

### Sprint 7

A rewards system mechanic is of least importance in comparison to the other mechanics, so it will be included in the seventh sprint. As such, this is the only inclusion along with the Korean localization that will be added in the final testing build.

### Sprint 8

This sprint is the final sprint with the main focus on tying up all of the loose ends of the project and implementing any important feedback as part of hte final wave of testing. The game should hopefully be at the point of full release at the middway point of the sprint with the latter half pollishing for hte client.


## Reflection

This task has been a great deal of insight into what goes into the head of people within the industry when it comes time to plan out a project that utilises sprints. It gives a good hint into what it will be like working as part of a smaller team of developers with different tools and skillsets, as the plans would have to stretch us out in a healthy manner to increase efficiency and avoid burnout. Trello was a wonderful tool to work with as it provided a base to plan out each sprint with cards that could be moved with ease in case a task could not be completed or had to be pushed to an earlier/later point within the development process.
