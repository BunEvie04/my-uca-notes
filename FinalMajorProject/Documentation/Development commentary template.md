## Project Outline
> - Provide a concise description of the project, including its core concept and purpose.  
> - Outline the initial goals or objectives you aim to achieve.  
> - Identify any anticipated challenges or potential issues that may arise during development.

The desired result is to develop the mechanics used in the prototype so that the player can learn the mechanics behind the animals alongside how items affect them in their routines.


My goals for this project include:
* Multiple animals present with different actions relating to them
* Player actions such as placeable items that interacts with the animals
* Different levels and goals for the player to complete

The development process will be set up and divided into sprints that will manage my time to effectively negate most work build-up. This maintains the agile methodology of working in short bursts with time to reflect and manage the current stages of a project during development. Being flexible will assist in any events of emergencies.


Some difficulties that I may have with this project can be found within the design elements around the stages, as most of my ideas are around the mechanics themselves with the level design coming into play to fit in with the features. Alongside this I worry if I will have enough time to flesh out the animals, which I will have to work on with methods such as trello boards and timelines.



## Research

### Methodology  
> - Identify relevant sources for the project, including articles, documentation, talks, and games.  
> - Detail how these sources have informed your practical work and influenced your approach.

Whilst researching for my game, core points behind the prototypes development were looked at to see if they can be expanded upon. This mainly came from Monster Hunter World (Capcom 2018), where the primary goal besides slaying the large creatures is to capture and study the world and how the monsters interact with it. This laid the groundwork for the ideas that would be used such as trapping and luring of monsters with tools.  
From here, I wanted to look at other games on the separate side of the spectrum of animals in games; from being creatures, to being tools and obstacles the player uses to move forward. This was an idea founded from 'Towards a Categorization of Animals in Video Games' (Jański, K. 2016), where they talk about how the usage of animals differs between games depending on the author's intent.  
The example that came to mind is Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker (Nintendo 2014) where the enemy encounters mainly consist of manoeuvring around them to get to the goal. I wanted to look at animals as tools as it may help with designing some puzzles and areas in game, especially as the fox in the prototype acted as such in its utilization as a platform. Since the game's premise is all about utilising animal behaviours in puzzles, I figured it'd be another good starting point for the main game.


### Game Sources  
> - Conduct research on games that are relevant to your project. Provide a brief description of each game and the insights it offers.  
> - Analyse the game's approach, cross-referencing it with other sources such as articles or talks to support your analysis.  
> - Explain how these insights apply to your project and influence your decision-making process.
> - Why the specific game in the series compared to others
> - DId they win awards etc.


#### Monster Hunter World (Capcom 2018)
This game became an inspiration with regards to how monsters behave in an environment uninterupted or otherwise. The environment is intractable with many options for the player to exploit monsters to capture or slay them. I talk about this specific entry in the series due to the increased development time and developed hardware which allowed the team behind the game to implement more behaviours into the monsters that inhabit the environment.

Such examples of this can include each monster having a cycle of activities they perform, from finding and eating food, to marking their territory, to fighting with other monsters over resources. One of my favourite monsters, named Vaal-Hazaak, displays this to a higher degree due to its symbiotic relationship with gasses released from the rotting flesh in its habitat, where it draws in small monsters when nearby.

Other parts of the game intrigue me with mechanics that I'd like to include in the final product, that being the hunter's notebook that the player would use to research the locations of the monsters and give hints on how to fight them. I'd like to include such an idea as a helpful guide book as a more diegetic way for the player to receive information on the animals in game.

This is a key point that I want to include within this developing game, that being animals that take have a loop of actions they perform whilst being reflexive around the players actions.


#### Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker (Nintendo 2014)
As part of the Super Mario series developed by Nintendo, this game is developed with the intention to be user friendly with a focus on putting the player first. The game revolves around using manoeuvring around enemies located within small scaled geometric levels alongside solving simple puzzles to collect items and reach the goal.
 
This game is another of my inspirations during development since I have the decision between the visual and the gameplay elements of the animals. This is something I have previously talked about (and will in the next section) but after looking at this game and performing some self-reflection on my skills as a developer, I have decided that focusing on the gameplay elements of the animals should come first and extra behaviours could come later as extra flourishes.



#### Nintendogs (Nintendo 2005)
The third game that struck out to me to research was Nintendogs, as this game, compared to the other two, has the animals as the primary focal point. The dogs behave as close to 1-1 as they would outside the digital space, as this is a virtual pet simulation. The game gives the player methods to interact with the dogs, either through caring for them with bath time and brushing, or through playing and joyful interactions. Perhaps through more personal interactions with the animals will the player truly get a feel for how they behave and give back to the game's world. Alternatively, for the short term, simply using tools that provide feeding and other interactive methods would work all the same.



### Academic Sources  
> - Research academic papers, books, or articles that provide theoretical guidance for your project. Include a brief summary of each source.  
> - Describe how the academic research applies to your project and shapes your design and development decisions.

* Refer back to written essay with taken notes and important reflections on the topic of animal behaviours in video games
* Academic sources and pages can be found there, will be relinked and talked about in brief

Previously I wrote an essay titled "How would Animal Behaviour translate into game formulas?", where I looked into numerous sources to talk about how animals can be utilised in video games and to what degree are they implemented to real world behaviours. The goal of this was to research into the topic to try and find that middle ground where the player can still become immersed into the animals behaviours and actions but don't take away from player actions/still allows the player to utilise them as game mechanics within the game itself.

Relating to the direct topic of animal behaviours doesn't appear often within academic papers. However, during my research I found a paper 'Towards a Categorization of Animals in Video Games' (Jański, K. 2016). One of the primary issue brought up within this work was the different "categorizations: one functional, one visual", with this relating to my work in how the different potential animals present would have to balance the line of how gamified it would be with its behaviours contrasting how it would outside of the screen.

Alternatively, when looking at 'Animals Video Games and Humanity (Tyler, T. 2022), they refer to how many video games use animals as interchangeable set pieces that are "confined to a restricted range of stereotypical movements" (pg 9). For the topic animals in games it rings true for a lot of games on the market, as it is quicker to have one set of motions for all the animals in a game when they aren't the main point. It wouldn't be a bad idea to incorporate this philosophy into the game with regards to similar activity shared between different animals. An example of this would be in how the animals could all search for food and divert the behaviours from there.



### Documentation Sources  
> - Investigate relevant documentation, tutorials, or instructional videos that provide technical insights into your tasks. Summarise the content and its relevance to your project.  
> - Explain how this technical knowledge supports your project work and guides your decision-making process.

Helpful tutorials and videos can assist down the line as my knowledge of a lot of unreal systems isn't the best. Using some tools to assist the process is always a good idea as this prevents slowdown due to lack of knowledge.

The main offenders when it came to needing tips were the menus and working with behaviour trees. Behaviour trees and everything attached (decorators, blackboard variables) are complex to understand for a first time use, so I have been using videos and tutorials to gather the basics of this to then expand upon through my own experimentation.

> - Include screenshots, diagrams, or code snippets where relevant to showcase your progress.

#### Developing the Animals/Behaviour Trees
Development of the game started with the main focus on the animals, as there wouldn't be much of a gameplay loop without them. From the prototype build I had a half working Fox animal with its associating grass food block and basic behaviour tree logic. Even if it took a bit more work to incorporate, I still wanted to include these components in the final build as they were the face of what would become "Hangry Animals". 

Before that, however, it was decided to start on another animal, the Kibby, as it would be a fresh look into the process. This was ultimately useful as its resulting actions and behaviours allowed it heavy usage across both the levels present in the final build. The Kibby would cycle between roaming spots and looking around. If it spotted its primary food source, the fruit, it would activate a boolean variable set in the behaviour tree's blackboard that would switch the tree's logic via a decorator. The resulting action being the Kibby moving towards and eating the food it spotted. Learning to set this up was a struggle as the blackboard variables would be unique to each instance, and it wasn't until I realised that they should be accessed through the AI Controller that everything fell into place.  
For the longest part of this project there was an issue that the animal would be activated to a fruit when it shouldn't when there were multiple, this was an error due to the "instance sync" tickbox being ticked, meaning any change to the blackboard variable affected everything using that blackboard. It wasn't until the topic was further researched that the solution was found.  
This Kibby animal was the first fleshed out animal to be included into the main project, with a focus on cycling the basic behaviours for the player to quickly pick up on. In addition, I decided to add a function to control whether or not the Kibby can move, with this being changable by the Kibby seeing food.  
The only other alteration the Kibby has compared to the other animals is its fear of fire, and item the player can use to scare them away. This gives the Kibby a unique behaviour that causes puzzles only it can be a part of.

Now that the Kibby is set up as the normal reusable animal, I felt it safe to continue work on optimising the Fox into the new version of the game, as there is a base to the game and the Fox would fit right in.  pipe

#### Feedback

```
I would have expected a little more features for a prototype. While everything is functional, it is quiet bare bones.
```
```
There some tasks where it was lacking research, when tackling any problem, its important to research and understand the problem you are trying to solve.
```

#### Improvements
Based on the **feedback** given on the prototype project and its development journal, it is clear that the final project needs to have more research put into each mechanic alongside having more substance inserted for the players enjoyment.

#### Idea Generation:
> This section will focus on the ideas that will be added into the game, with new ideas being expanded upon within their relevant sections


Using the prototype, compare to similar games and research mechanics that could fit into the game, ensuring that the main idea of a puzzle game primarily utilizing the animal behaviour remains intact.
* Monster hunter
  * Monsters are used for combat, which there will be no combat present in the game
  * Interactions with items still occur however that influence the behaviour:
    * Torch pods create fire on the ground where they land that monsters shy away from
    * Other ammo when fired lure monsters to areas
    * Drugged meat can be placed that inflicts status effects including drowsiness, paralysis and poison
    * Environmental objects can be triggered to hide the player/interup the monster
* Captain Toad
  * Enemies block off areas which the player has to maneuver around/kill to progress

As well as that, looking at examples of interactions with animals irl can give insight into mechanics
* Some animals hunt and harm other beings due to needing to eat
* Being threatened can cause violent retaliation in animals
  * (Lethal Company) Baboon Hawks maintain distance constantly with the player(s) 
and attack dependant on if the player remains close for too long/holding weapons/more people
* Feeling threatened can also cause other animals to flee instead

From this I can create new mechanic ideas that have potential to fit into the game:
* Different creatures with some behaviours that are unique and some shared
* Hidden meters for features like being threatened by other entities/player
* Utilisation of fire can be used to scare animals/coherce them into/away from locations
* Moving around/avoiding certain animals to reach locations
  * Animal could be hostile(?) and player needs to avoid being caught
  * Animal might be a passive roadblock
* Other item types besides grass that create different outcomes with the environment
  * Meat only lures carnivorous animals for example

* Natural item that player has to pick up, takes animals some time to eat
 * Can ask player to collect item from area
 * Player places for animal to eat in location, can be then used as platform


#### Assets
 
Key in making everything look more polished without taking the important time away from development. If time permits then I can go back and create key assets for an extra flair.

#### Research points
##### Pathfinding

Research into pathfinding will be needed as the animal in the prototype moved only in a straight line, and pathfinding will allow better gameplay and prevent anything from getting stuck.

##### Better Hitboxes

Working on a better hitbox on the animal would be great as it would previously push the player on its way to its destination, this would partially fix the issue. However a fix on the stepping mechanic would be needed as its currently connected to the animal itself.

##### C++ Conversion

If felt appropriate, working on swapping some bp out for c++ would work, as it improves my knowledge on the subject and increases performance. This, however, will be a stretch goal for the project and will therefore be relagated towards minor things. This will be done like this

#### Styling and Level Design

The current plan is to focus on an isometric style of game which will be easier to view and allows for simpler level design, as slopes, plains and pits will be enough for a first level. 

Development of the first level will become crucial for the first few weeks as it allows the game to become testable as a baseline for the true game. The level should be simple with the pickup and place grass mechanic from the prototype present. Other simpler mechanics can be added to improve the lack of gameplay that was in the prototype.

#### Timeline of Events

This section will focus on the plan of events that should line up with the trello board 
https://trello.com/b/aw9D4OtI/fmp-animal-game

* Build the first level geometry using simple shapes
* Add in basic pathfinding to replace ai movement
 
>6/2


Started research into pathfinding using the epic tutorial on the basic work

Starting with the blockout for the work

>7/2
* Found out using navmodifier volume with object avioudance works to prevent the animal from taking certain paths, this may work for now but another solution may need to be found later in development that uses less processing power
* Figuring out how to address the pit shenanigans in the main game

The map will be based on a hill setting, with a basic introductory puzzle using the mechanic introduced in the prototype.
After that will be another mechanic with an item that will distract an animal for a time, allowing the player to get past for more puzzle ideas



>8/2

3 first level mechanics
* Direct grass movement
 * Prototype mechanic
 * Reserved for the first animal
* Fire avoidance
 * Placeable for most animals
 * Fire close by moves animals away from area
* Big food
 * Stops to eat
 * Looks for more before idling

Making the pit fall more consistent with a collision box that makes a platform when the animal collides with it in the pit. This is done by making the collision of the new box change when it collides with the animal, so it then prevents the player from falling through.

Next steps would be to add the encyclopedia to the game to explain the mechanic of an animal once the player is in sight of one.

>21/2

Everything was fixed with gitlfs so now work into the new systems can begin
anymal has been made, being a cat model stand-in. 
Up next is editing ui to be multipage with inventory built into the first one.
adding more behaviours for second animal to align with fruit


>22/2

Third person character can now pick up multiple items one at a time, working towards multiple later if needed but allows different items to be used within the level. When same time item pickup is needed an inventory will be added to the book as its first page.


>Week of the 24th (week3???)

This week focused on some visual features including the UI for menus, changing user settings, basic saving, and building the level mechanics for the first stage.

The help menu from the prototype was repurposed into the pause menu, which contained useful buttons like:
* Resume
  * Un-pauses the game
* Save
  * Saves the variables related to the current game state in its own spot
  * Currently only saves the player position for now
* Restart from Point
  * Returns all variables saved in savegame back into the game
* Restart Level
  * Restarts the level from scratch
  * Currently incompatible with savegame
* Title Screen
  * Returns the player to the title screen
* Quit Game
  * Closes the game
* Settings
  * Opens the settings menu

(Screenshot here)


Alongside the pause screen, a settings menu was added to allow the player to customise their experience to match their system and preferences. There are working drop-down boxes that display and select the players desired window and resolution combined with sliders for audio management on music and sound effects. Currently the graphical settings work as intended but without any audio added into the project I cannot be too sure if the audio sliders are fully functioning.

(Gifs of combobox and sliders)


The cat (a stand-in name for the second ai animal) was further developed in its behaviour. It is similar to the prototype in how it patrols and moves towards food but differs in how it goes about each task. As a second attempt on the behaviour tree it became more streamlined and readable so more events could be added if needed.  
A pawnsensing component has been added, which means the cat will roam until it sees the necessary item within its eyesight. Once this occurs it will change behaviour to move towards it and stay there (mimicking eating). This is planned to be the ai base that will be the source of most of the puzzles in future levels.


This first level being blocked out will be made to showcase the very basic mechanic of placing items and working with the animals. Split into two very short sections, the first utilises the prototype animal due to its simple nature in the pit falling mechanic seen previously in the prototype. The second area will contain a larger space with trees to spawn food items the player can use to lure the cat out of the goal area.

Reference for future efforts:
* Addition of spawners working and dropping fruit
* Working behaviour trees to activate when needed

>To be dated but other additions/workflow
>>Week 4
* Title menu
  * The title menu was updated slightly to have options for: a new game, load game, settings menu, exit button, and the option for the prototype
* Apple mechanics
  * The basic apple is similar to the grass block from the prototype but is planned to be able to be spawned in by a tree actor, alongside growing when spawned and shrinking when being eaten
  * This week was spent on getting the apple to detect when the cat is nearby alongside the destruction events for it.
* More map detail

>>Week5

* Spawning functions for apples
  * The next step for the apples would be to add the tree actor itself with an event to spawn the apples at a selected amount. This could be simply done through a spawn actor node but for the purposes of what I required, it was not the most efficient solution.
  * My first thoughts was to create an actor component that could be attached to the tree actors. Functions were added to get an array of the number of trees present in the level, alongside another to get each a location offset for where to spawn the apples. A great deal of time was spent on this, including the development and research into structs to try and get this process to work, as each tree that was in the level would have a maximum of (at the time) two apples that would spawn nearby. 
  * That plan proved futile as I had discovered that using a linked custom event connected to the spawn actor within the tree actor blueprint automatically attaches the two together, allowing each trees counter to decrease independantly when its own apple is removed from play.

* Missteps with ActorComponent, Functions and Structs
* The right answer

>>Week6

* Spawner function for inventory work


* Future in the week:
  * Object pool
    * Integer for the amount of apples currently in the level, with the eating of the apple increasing the value and the lowering of it for spawning it
    * Picking the item up would be neutral as it would add one before removing one, and vice versa for dropping it.
    * Testing will need to be done to check this would work properly
  * Bug fixes
    * Animal destroys the object from a distance
  
  * Proper level finishes
    * Finishing the level design and implementing developed mechanics
    * Creating a build that can be user tested.


>>Week7

Objectives:
* Pressureplate/Button
  * Detects number of entities _Y
  * Detects specific entities using tags _Y
  * Activates items in the level _X
 
* Cage actor
  * Can be dropped by button
  * Can be dragged by player along one axis


Odd Jobs:
Reorganise and rename animals for easier navigation
Constrain items so they don't fly off everywhere

>> Week8

* Worked out the packaging issue on the project to finally allow the project to be uploaded onto itch for more chances of being tested.
  * Had issues previously where the project when packaged and zipped would be over a gigabyte in size
  * After specifying the maps to be included in the build alongside other smaller changes, the total size was reduced

* The fire mechanic to be implemented is very basic, but the model can be replaced after the game is finished mechanically
  * It would have the purpose of being placed in front of the player in an attempt to scare the animal away
  * The player would recieve the item at some point within a level and be freely able to use it from that point onwards
  * Has varying effects depending on the animal in the line of sight
  * The Kibby would more in the opposing direction unless is is in dire need of food, in which it would be more direct
    * A hunger bar/meter would need to be added to the animal and the blackboard to ensure that this purpose can be met
      * Being visible to the player to be increasingly helpful, at the cost of immersion, as there aren't any animations I have currently that can display the tiredness to the player


>> Week9

* Fixed some blueprints belonging to a classmate on moving enemies without a behaviour tree
* The cat now runs away when it sees fire

* Grass needs fixing to be more consistent

* Starting to replace MoveToLocation with AIMoveTo as it has the option to only continue after the movement is complete

>> Week 10 
* Finished level 1 and accompanying mechanics
* Start Planning the development of levels two, three and bonus level
  * Level 2
    * Based around the town at the top of the hill
    * Moving small groups of animals using luring tools to push/pull their attention
    * Once all groups have been collected into the central area, move into the end zone
  * Level 3
    * 

Next steps:
- Block out level 2
  - Uses the runaway item for herding animals into a given location
  - Subclass/child of kibby with wider vision/other adjustments to suit the task
  - Possibly use lighter food at the end with pouch upgrade?

- Block out level 3
  - more local to people
  - uses cages and pushing to move animals to locations
  - later segment utilising this and food/lvl2 mechanic to manipulate animal to location
 
- Fishing minigame
  - Secret level
  - Mini roaming animal
  - Stretch goal

- Showcase mindmap with layout


>> Week 11

* Starting development of level 2
  * Sheep was added by following the blueprints of the the Kibby while placing it onto the same behaviour tree
    * Was changed to have a wider view of the area
    * More focus on the fear/eating rather than the movement and resting
    * Could add interactions between them
  * Ladder added
    * Due to the level focus having the higher ground to view the puzzles and gather materials, ladders were made so the player could traverse the level easier
  * 3 Different sections for the player to gather the animals
    * One teaches the player about the button and cages that can be used to push the animals into the main area
      * Shows they're pushable by placing them in the players way
      * Give larger fruit that take longer to eat (show Kibby on the side with the bushes and larger fruit)
      * Use larger fruit to be placed underneath to be used as bait
     
* Push block into floor for path forward
* Button to spawn the walkable block while overseeing kibby with larger fruit
* See sheep and try to guide it onto the platform to be captured
* Push sheep off edge

* 2nd option, go for mass capture
* Either way push a block at the end of the stage back into the main area



    * The second gives the player the ability to use a lighter/sign (to be determined) which causes the animals to be navigated into the main area
      * Anything that gets placed/used stays in the location
      * Planned out obstacle course using the mechanic

> - Explain why these approaches were chosen and how they differ from standard practices.  
> - Evaluate the success of these approaches, including any challenges faced and lessons learned.

### Testing
> - Document the user testing conducted, specifying the type of tests used (e.g., automated testing, guided user testing, blind testing).  
> - Present feedback or issues identified during testing, using graphs, tables, or visual aids to summarise results.  
> - Describe how these issues were addressed. If any issues were not resolved, provide a clear justification for leaving them unaddressed.

### Technical Difficulties
> - Identify any technical difficulties encountered during the implementation phase.  
> - Provide details on how these issues were diagnosed and resolved.  
> - If any difficulties remain unresolved, explain the impact on the project and any mitigation strategies used to minimise their effect.  
> - Reflect on what you would do differently in future projects to avoid similar issues.

* Git LFS overusing its data quota, preventing me from accessing the project until it gets fixed
  * This was caused by the file structure and setup of Git LFS being incorrect, this was changed by organising the files and folders in the project into 'Dynamic' and 'Static'. From there the git ignore file was altered to only use LFS on the larger files/one of the folders.
* This created another issue when cloning the project on another device; where some of the blueprint files would not appear within the UE5 editor
  * A solution was to directly place the missing files into their respective locations, gathering the new files from an older commit where they appeared still.


## Outcomes

### Source Code/Project Files
> - Provide a link to your complete source code or project files.  
> - Ensure the link is publicly accessible or shared with the appropriate permissions.  
> - Include a brief description of the files provided, highlighting key components or any instructions required to run the project.

### Build Link
> - Share a link to a playable or executable build of your project.  
> - Ensure the build is accessible across relevant platforms and is publicly accessible.  
> - Include any necessary instructions for running the build, such as system requirements or installation steps.

### Video Demonstration
> - Embed a video or provide a link to a recorded demonstration of your project in action.  
> - The video should showcase key features, functionality, and any unique elements of your project.  
> - Include a brief commentary or text overlay in the video to explain the different aspects of your project as they are shown.

## Reflection

### Research Effectiveness  
> - Assess the usefulness of the research conducted during the project.  
> - Highlight which sources (games, academic, documentation) had the most significant impact on your work and explain why.  
> - Identify any research gaps or areas where additional information could have improved your project outcomes.

### Positive Analysis 
> - Reflect on the successful aspects of the project.  
> - Highlight specific elements that worked well, such as technical solutions, creative decisions, or user feedback.  
> - Provide evidence to support your analysis, such as test results, screenshots, or user comments.

### Negative Analysis  
> - Identify the areas of the project that did not go as planned or could have been improved.  
> - Discuss challenges you faced, whether technical, creative, or time-related, and evaluate their impact on the final product.  
> - Reflect on any mistakes or missteps and what you learned from them.

* Understanding more about how Github works with Git LFS
  * Portions of the working timeline have been cut due to having an inaccessable project
* Working with item management for puzzles
  * Linking each instance of a spawning actor with a set amount of sub actors (tree instances spawning a set amount of apples each)

### Next Time
> - Outline what you would do differently if you were to undertake a similar project again.  
> - Suggest improvements to your workflow, research methods, or implementation process based on your reflections.  
> - Consider any new tools, techniques, or approaches you would explore in future projects to achieve better results.

## Bibliography  
> - Compile a complete list of all sources referenced throughout your project. This may include articles, journals, videos, games, software, documentation, or any other materials.
> - Ensure all references are formatted according to the [university's citation method](https://mylibrary.uca.ac.uk/referencing).  
> - Organise your references in alphabetical order. Alternatively, you may separate them by type (e.g., academic sources, games, videos), but consistency is key.

To be updated properly later:
* Monster Hunter World
 * Capcom 2018
* Captain Toad

## Declared Assets
> - Provide a detailed list of any third-party assets used in the project.  
> - This includes asset packs, music, sound effects, 3D models, textures, scripts, or code from external sources.  
> - Declare any use of AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Meshy) or pre-existing code. Specify the purpose of these assets/tools and how they were integrated into your work.  
> - Ensure you clearly distinguish between your original work and any external contributions to maintain academic integrity.
