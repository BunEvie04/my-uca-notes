## Feedback

```
I would have expected a little more features for a prototype. While everything is functional, it is quiet bare bones.
```
```
There some tasks where it was lacking research, when tackling any problem, its important to research and understand the problem you are trying to solve.
```

## Improvements
Based on the feedback given on the prototype project and its development journal, it is clear that the final project needs to have more research put into each mechanic alongside haveing more substance insirted for the players enjoyment.

## Ideas:
Using the prototype, compare to similar games and research mechanics that could fit into the game, ensuring that the main idea of a puzzle game primarily utilizing the animal behaviour remains intact.
* Monster hunter
  * Monsters are used for combat, which there will be no combat present in the game
  * Interactions with items still occur however that influence the behaviour:
    * Torch pods create fire on the ground where they land that monsters shy away from
    * Other ammo when fired lure monsters to areas
    * Drugged meat can be placed that inflicts status effects including drowsiness, paralysis and poison
    * Environmental objects can be triggered to hide the player/interup the monster
* Captain Toad
  * Enemies block off areas which the player has to maneuver around/kill to progress

As well as that, looking at examples of interactions with animals irl can give insight into mechanics
* Some animals hunt and harm other beings due to needing to eat
* Being threatened can cause violent retaliation in animals
  * (Lethal Company) Baboon Hawks maintain distance constantly with the player(s) 
and attack dependant on if the player remains close for too long/holding weapons/more people
* Feeling threatened can also cause other animals to flee instead

From this I can create new mechanic ideas that have potential to fit into the game:
* Different creatures with some behaviours that are unique and some shared
* Hidden meters for features like being threatened by other entities/player
* Utilisation of fire can be used to scare animals/coherce them into/away from locations
* Moving around/avoiding certain animals to reach locations
  * Animal could be hostile(?) and player needs to avoid being caught
  * Animal might be a passive roadblock
* Other item types besides grass that create different outcomes with the environment
  * Meat only lures carnivorous animals for example

* Natural item that player has to pick up, takes animals some time to eat
 * Can ask player to collect item from area
 * Player places for animal to eat in location, can be then used as platform



## Key Points
This section focuses on the important parts that will be added into the main game, through feedback or other research, and will help build stronger foundations

### Free Assets
 
Key in making everything look more polished without taking the important time away from development. If time permits then I can go back and create key assets for an extra flair.

### Pathfinding

Research into pathfinding will be needed as the animal in the prototype moved only in a straight line, and pathfinding will allow better gameplay and prevent anything from getting stuck.

### Better Hitboxes

Working on a better hitbox on the animal would be great as it would previously push the player on its way to its destination, this would partially fix the issue. However a fix on the stepping mechanic would be needed as its currently connected to the animal itself.

### C++ Conversion

If time permits and I should feel inclined, working on swapping some bp out for c++ would work, as it improves my knowledge on the subject and increases performance.

### Styling and Level Design

The current plan is to focus on an isometric style of game which will be easier to view and allows for simpler level design, as slopes, plains and pits will be enough for a first level. 

Development of the first level will become crucial for the first few weeks as it allows the game to become testable as a baseline for the true game. The level should be simple with the pickup and place grass mechanic from the prototype present. Other simpler mechanics can be added to improve the lack of gameplay that was in the prototype.

## Roadmap

This section will focus on the plan of events that should line up with the trello board 
https://trello.com/b/aw9D4OtI/fmp-animal-game

* Build the first level geometry using simple shapes
* Add in basic pathfinding to replace ai movement
*

Started research into pathfinding using the epic tutorial on the basic work

Starting with the blockout for hte work
