## Feedback

```
I would have expected a little more features for a prototype. While everything is functional, it is quiet bare bones.
```
```
There some tasks where it was lacking research, when tackling any problem, its important to research and understand the problem you are trying to solve.
```

## Improvements
Based on the feedback given on the prototype project and its development journal, it is clear that the final project needs to have more research put into each mechanic alongside haveing more substance insirted for the players enjoyment.

## Ideas:
Using the prototype, compare to similar games and research mechanics that could fit into the game, ensuring that the main idea of a puzzle game primarily utilizing the animal behaviour remains intact.
* Monster hunter
  * Monsters are used for combat, which there will be no combat present in the game
  * Interactions with items still occur however that influence the behaviour:
    * Torch pods create fire on the ground where they land that monsters shy away from
    * Other ammo when fired lure monsters to areas
    * Drugged meat can be placed that inflicts status effects including drowsiness, paralysis and poison
    * Environmental objects can be triggered to hide the player/interup the monster
* Captain Toad
  * Enemies block off areas which the player has to maneuver around/kill to progress

As well as that, looking at examples of interactions with animals irl can give insight into mechanics
* Some animals hunt and harm other beings due to needing to eat
* Being threatened can cause violent retaliation in animals
  * (Lethal Company) Baboon Hawks maintain distance constantly with the player(s) 
and attack dependant on if the player remains close for too long/holding weapons/more people
  * Feeling threatened can also cause other animals to flee instead

From this I can create new mechanic ideas that have potential to fit into the game:
