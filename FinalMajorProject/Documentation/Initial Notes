## Feedback

```
I would have expected a little more features for a prototype. While everything is functional, it is quiet bare bones.
```
```
There some tasks where it was lacking research, when tackling any problem, its important to research and understand the problem you are trying to solve.
```

## Improvements
Based on the feedback given on the prototype project and its development journal, it is clear that the final project needs to have more research put into each mechanic alongside haveing more substance insirted for the players enjoyment.

## Ideas:
Using the prototype, compare to similar games and research mechanics that could fit into the game, ensuring that the main idea of a puzzle game primarily utilizing the animal behaviour remains intact.
