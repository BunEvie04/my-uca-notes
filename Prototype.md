# Prototype Ideas

## Game ideas

Puzzle platformer relying on ai behaviour and interaction within the world

Using a tiled grid based world alongside shaped creatures (like a box mammoth) to progress onwards in the game  
The Prototype goal is to have a simple level featuring at least one moving creature with basic AI

## Engine

UE5

## Language

C++

## Possible mechanics to focus on
- AI implementation through both docile and aggressive creatures
    - The creatures themselves can have AI pathways that influence what it does
    - Interacting with the environment through its behaviours
    - Switching between a searching phase, a resting phase and an eating phase
    - Phases get cycled through from resting -> searching -> eating and so forth
- Inventory system to store and use items
    - Keys used to open doors
    - Creature interaction
- Different movement types to enable world traversal
    - Climbing
    - Jumps (possibly more than one)
- Attacks as a form of interaction
- Movable blocks within the world
- Character dialogue as in universe explanations
- Carrying mechanic
    - Larger items
    - Possibly the creatures within reason

## Level Plan

The overal plan for the prototype is to get from point A (at the bottom of a hill) to point B(at the top of the hill). This can be accomplished through puzzle solving with the different mechanics at play. 


There will be a fur coated animal which covers one to four tiles total, with it having options between different patches of tall grass to eat at, with gaps between resting.
