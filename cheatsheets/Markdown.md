# Headings

This is how you do headings

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
```
## Paragraphs

```
Paragraphs use 1 blank line between

Like this
```

## Linebreaks

```
Meanwhile linebreaks leave  
two spaces after  
the previous line
```

## Bold & Italics

**Bold** lettering is done with two asterisks  

```
**Like this**
```

*Italics*  use 1 asterisk

```
*like this*
```

Having 3 ***combines*** the two

```
***Meow***
```

## Blockquotes

>Block quotes use the > symbol
>
>with a > blank lines for paragraphs
>
>>and a nested paragraph made by doubling the > into >>

```
>like this
>
>and this
>
>>finally this too
```

># Blockquotes can combine other elements with experimentation required

```
>Known ones can include:
># Headings
>- Lists
>>More experimentation required
```

## Lists

Lists are done with ordered and unordered  
1. Ordered is done with numbers followed by periods
- Unordered can utilise numerous symbols to activate, but dashes are simplest

```
1. Example 1
- Example 2
```

Having numbers with periods after an unordered list should be followed by a backslash
- 00\.

```
- 00\.
```
